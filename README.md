# AutomaticVsManualTransmissions-RegressionModeling

Link to the published project is [here](https://rpubs.com/kevinroche22/TransmissionEffectsAnalysis), or if you prefer presentation format, [here.](https://rpubs.com/kevinroche22/TransmissionEffectsPresentation) Completed as the course project for JHU's regression models and data products courses as part of their data science specialization. I've also built a shiny [app](https://kevinroche22.shinyapps.io/mpgPredictionShinyApp/) to predict mpg based on the model, with a major caveat - the underlying model used for prediction would never be used in a production setting, it was just used in an effort to learn how to build shiny apps.

This project uses the mpg dataset to answer two questions:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
