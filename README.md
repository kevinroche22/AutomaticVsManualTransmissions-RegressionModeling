# AutomaticVsManualTransmissions-RegressionModeling

Link to the published project is [here](https://rpubs.com/kevinroche22/TransmissionEffectsAnalysis). Completed as the course project for JHU's regression models course, the seventh course in the data science specialization.

This project uses the mpg dataset to answer two questions:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
