# AutomaticVsManualTransmissions-RegressionModeling

Link to the published project is [here](https://rpubs.com/kevinroche22/TransmissionEffectsAnalysis), or if you prefer presentation format, [here.](https://rpubs.com/kevinroche22/TransmissionEffectsPresentation) Completed as the course project for JHU's regression models and data products courses as part of their data science specialization.

This project uses the mpg dataset to answer two questions:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
